After that you sould be able to see the results.

- This frontend project enables You to check the weather in various cities across the globe;
- Due to the chosen method (Autocomplete input) I had to shorten the list of available cities,
normally there are more than million cities, but it was really hard to search through and lagged whole app,
it would probebly be a task for a backend service to serve most probable cities based on what user is inputing.
- You can both add and delete cities
- Every city has listed its name, overall weather's icon, temperature in Celsius, how high does the temperature feels like and wind speed in m/s.
